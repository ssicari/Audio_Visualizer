# Audio Visualizer - Real-Time Frequency Analysis

Â© 2025 Sal Sicari

Overview

This project is a real-time audio visualizer built with C++ and SFML that processes MP3 audio files, extracts their raw data, and applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze frequency distribution. The visualizer then maps these frequencies into a dynamic graphical representation, allowing users to see the structure of sound as it plays.

This project was designed to explore audio signal processing, frequency domain analysis, and real-time visualization techniques while maintaining efficient performance.

Features

Real-time frequency analysis using FFT to break down sound into its component frequencies.

Dynamic graphical representation of audio data using SFML.

Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth visualization with minimal latency.

Customizable visual effects (e.g., color mapping, bar animations, amplitude scaling).

Future Upgrades & Enhancements

Performance & Optimization

Improve FFT processing efficiency for smoother real-time rendering.

Optimize CPU/GPU usage to reduce lag when handling high-frequency ranges.

Expanded Audio Support

Extend compatibility beyond MP3 files to support WAV, FLAC, and streaming audio.

Implement real-time microphone input support for visualizing live audio.

Advanced Visualization Features

Introduce 3D audio visualization for a more immersive experience.

Add custom user-controlled themes for personalized aesthetics.

Implement beat detection and audio reactivity to enhance visual synchronization with music.

Current Limitations

Currently supports MP3 audio only (no real-time microphone input yet).

FFT processing is functional but could be further optimized for better responsiveness.

This project is a work in progress, and I welcome any contributions, feedback, or collaboration opportunitie
